<p>
  I'm a DPhil Student in Sociology at the University of Oxford. My research tries to use genomic data to improve the identification of causal links between risk factors and life outcomes interesting to social scientists.

<p>
  I like to play with data, computers, and politics.

<p>
  Since the content about me you might be looking for is still to be developed (cv, working papers, projects, datasets, software), I'll deploy a - mostly irrelevant - quote I like. 
</p>

<p><i>My second maxim was to be as firm and resolute in my actions as I was able, and not to adhere less steadfastly to the most doubtful opinions, when once adopted, than if they had been highly certain; imitating in this the example of travelers who, when they have lost their way in a forest, ought not to wander from side to side, far less remain in one place, but proceed constantly towards the same side in as straight a line as possible, without changing their direction for slight reasons, although perhaps it might be chance alone which at first determined the selection; for in this way, if they do not exactly reach the point they desire, they will come at least in the end to some place that will probably be preferable to the middle of a forest. In the same way, since in action it frequently happens that no delay is permissible, it is very certain that, when it is not in our power to determine what is true, we ought to act according to what is most probable; and even although we should not remark a greater probability in one opinion than in another, we ought notwithstanding to choose one or the other, and afterwards consider it, in so far as it relates to practice, as no longer dubious, but manifestly true and certain, since the reason by which our choice has been determined is itself possessed of these qualities. This principle was sufficient thenceforward to rid me of all those repentings and pangs of remorse that usually disturb the consciences of such feeble and uncertain minds as, destitute of any clear and determinate principle of choice, allow themselves one day to adopt a course of action as the best, which they abandon the next, as the opposite.</i> (<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/59/59-h/59-h.htm">Ren√© Descartes, A discours on Method</a>)</p>
